# Weather Expressions

## Introduction to Weather Idioms

Weather expressions in Spanish are **idiomatic expressions** that cannot be understood literally. Many use the verb **hacer** (to do/make) but have weather-related meanings.

**Example:**

```markdown
Hace mucho fr√≠o. / It is very cold.
(Literally: "It makes much cold")
```

> üìù **Note**: Weather expressions are idiomatic - don't translate them literally!

## Weather Expressions with *Hacer*

The verb **hacer** is commonly used in Spanish weather idioms:

### Basic Weather with *Hacer*

- *el fr√≠o* (the cold)
- *el calor* (the heat)
- *el viento* (the wind)
