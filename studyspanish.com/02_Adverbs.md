# Adverbs

Adverbs describe or modify:

- **Verbs**: *He ran quickly.*
- **Adjectives**: *Thatâ€™s really good.*
- **Other adverbs**: *She spoke more slowly than him.*

## Regular Formation of Adverbs

Most adverbs are formed by adding **-mente** to the **feminine singular form** of the adjective.

| Adjective (Masc.) | Feminine Form | Adverb         | Meaning         |
| ----------------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| claro             | clara         | claramente     | clearly         |
| constante         | constante     | constantemente | constantly      |
| difÃ­cil           | difÃ­cil       | difÃ­cilmente   | with difficulty |

> ðŸ”¸ If the adjective has a written accent, the adverb **retains** it.  
> e.g., *fÃ¡cil â†’ fÃ¡cilmente*

## Alternate Formation: Using "con + noun"

Another way to form adverbs is by using **con + singular noun form**.

| Adjective               | Adverb with -mente | Equivalent with "con" |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| cuidadoso (careful)     | cuidadosamente     | con cuidado           |
| perfecto (perfect)      | perfectamente      | con perfecciÃ³n        |
| cariÃ±oso (affectionate) | cariÃ±osamente      | con cariÃ±o            |

> âœ… Both forms are grammatically correct.

## Irregular / Common Adverbs

Some adverbs do **not** follow a pattern and must be memorized:

- **bastante** â€“ quite
- **demasiado** â€“ too
- **mal** â€“ badly
- **mucho** â€“ a lot
- **muy** â€“ very
- **nunca** â€“ never
- **peor** â€“ worse
- **poco** â€“ little
- **siempre** â€“ always

## Multiple Adverbs in Sequence

When **two adverbs** modify the same verb, **only the second** one takes the **-mente** ending.  
The first is used in **feminine singular adjective** form.

| Sentence (Spanish)                         | Translation                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Juan trabaja **lenta y cuidadosamente**.   | Juan works slowly and carefully.       |
| El autor escribiÃ³ **rÃ¡pida y fÃ¡cilmente**. | The author wrote quickly and easily.   |
| El chico le hablÃ³ **clara y cortÃ©smente**. | The boy spoke clearly and courteously. |
