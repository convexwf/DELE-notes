## Gender of Nouns

A noun is a word used to denote a person, place, thing, or idea.

In Spanish, all nouns are either masculine or feminine.

| Masculine         | Feminine                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| el chico(boy)     | la chica(girl)             |
| el jardín(garden) | la universidad(university) |
| el libro(book)    | la revista(magazine)       |
| el miedo(fear)    | la libertad(liberty)       |

In English, living creatures often have different names, depending upon whether they are male or female. That is the same in Spanish, maybe even more so.

| Masculine              | Feminine               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| el gato(male cat)      | la gata(female cat)    |
| el perro(male dog)     | la perra(female dog)   |
| el chico(boy)          | la chica(girl)         |
| el abuelo(grandfather) | la abuela(grandmother) |

Nouns that end in **-o** are usually masculine. Nouns that end in **-a** are usually feminine. There are exceptions to these two rules as well.

### definite article

`el` and `la` both mean `the`. These two words (el, la) are called `“definite articles.“` .

When you learn a new noun, you should also learn its definite article (el, la). There are several reasons for this:

- Because you cannot predict the gender of most nouns.
- Because not every noun that ends in -o is masculine, and not every noun that ends in -a is feminine.
- Because many nouns end in letters other than o or a.
- Because the definite article (el, la) is your clue as to whether a noun is masculine or feminine.

**Some rules to help identify the gender of nouns**

(1) Many nouns that denote **living things** have both a **masculine** and a **feminine** form.

(2) Most nouns that end in **-o** are **masculine**, and most nouns that end in **-a** are **feminine**.

Four of the **masculine** nouns that end in **-a** are simply exceptions and must be memorized.

- el día
- el mapa
- el planeta
- el sofá

Similarly, a few nouns that end in **-o** are **feminine**.

- la mano
- la radio

(3) **Masculine** nouns that end in a consonant often have a corresponding **feminine** form that ends in **-a**.

| Masculine                 | Feminine                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| el profesor(male teacher) | la profesora(female teacher) |
| el doctor(male doctor)    | la doctora(female doctor)    |
| el señor(Mr.)             | la señora(Mrs.)              |

(4) Some nouns that refer to people use the same form for both masculine and feminine. These nouns indicate gender by the article (el or la).

| Masculine              | Feminine               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| el estudiante(student) | la estudiante(student) |
| el pianista(pianist)   | la pianista(pianist)   |
| el artista(artist)     | la artista(artist)     |

(5) Many nouns that end in **-ma** are **masculine**.

- el telegrama
- el programa
- el problema
- el sistema
- el poema
- el idioma
- el clima
- el tema

A few nouns that end in **-ma** are **feminine**, such as `la cama` and `la pluma`.

(6) Nouns that end in `-sión`, `-ción`, `-dad`, `-tad`, `-tud`, `-umbre` are **feminine**.

- la televisión
- la decisión
- la conversación
- la habitación
- la ciudad
- la universidad
